Decision-maker brief
	- MoA less developed than MoH
	- Animal and human health surveillance not unified
	- Animal health - public service and private service 
	- Before devolution, it was component of central government and there was someone to look after that 
	- Private sector came in to help
	- Everyone operating separately 
	- 2018 - Kenyan Animal Biosurveillance System (KABS)
	- Put their own data into KABS 
	- All practioners record events into this 
	- Not been picked up by everyone 
	- Reporting low
	- People take their pets to private clinics but they don't report to KABS
	- Research institutions also have different 
	- Data cleaning & analysis not automated 
	- Having a dashboard where can interpret the data from different sources 
	- Give a comprehensive view of animal health in Kenya
	- These data are used for decision-making 


Discussion
	- Is there an API for KABS?
		○ Typically download & analyse, unclear if there is an API
		○ There is an API for new KABS but hosting is ongoing
	- Will show us front and back end 
	- Have KABS data, but can get the other data 
	- KABS undergoing changes 
	- Labs have their own system 
	- Does KABS allow data import? - not right now but working on currently 
	- Animal health data more event based than surveillance
