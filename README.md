# Animal surveillance 

Problem:
The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Development (MoA) want to have a centralised source for all animal health information across Kenya. The MoA maintains the Kenya Animal Biosurveillance System (KABS), but information comes from multiple sources.
Our tasks this week are the following:
* Automate data cleaning for all input data sources (Anne, Ruth).
* Create a centralised database that reads in data from KABS and other sources (Anne, Ruth).
* Draft a dashboard to display these data, to track outbreak frequency over time(Month)- Demo dataset provided, with a particular focus on prioirity diseases, transmission chains, cases[outbreaks]- Number at Risk, Death,Sick, Destrroyed,Slaughtered and location of the reports - Disease hotspt across counties in Kenya (Ryan, Arani).

Further details are provided in Notes folder.

Plan for Tuesday:
* Onboard Brian to the family.
* Anne and Ryan to demo what they have worked on so far.
* Anne, Brian and Ruth to advance data cleaning in conjunction with decision-makers.
* Ryan and Arani to work on dashboard.
