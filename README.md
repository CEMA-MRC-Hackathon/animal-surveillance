# Animal surveillance 

Problem:
The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Development (MoA) want to have a centralised source for all animal health information across Kenya. The MoA maintains the Kenya Animal Biosurveillance System (KABS), but information comes from multiple sources.
Our tasks this week are the following:
* Automate data cleaning for all input data sources.
* Create a centralised database that reads in data from KABS and other sources.
* Draft a dashboard to display these data, with a particular focus on prioirity diseases, transmission chains, cases and location of the reports.
